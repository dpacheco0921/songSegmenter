Our version of the Flysongsegmenter ([Arthur et al., 2013][1]). 
[Original code][2] modified by Pip Coen. 

See `demo_singleChannelRecording.m` and `demo_multiChannelRecording.m` for usage and comparison with hand-annotated song data.

The song for the single-channel demo is a recording from the data supplement of [Stern (2014)][3]. The hand-annotation for that song comes from the supplemental material of [Kyriacou et al. (2017)][4]. The multi-channel demo uses an unpublished recording of _Drosophila melanogaster_ and was hand-annotated using the [manual segmenter][5].
